# REFLECTION I | LOWE ART MUSEUM

Visiting the Lowe Art Museum with Jodi as a guide was a great experience. Being able to hear firsthand from an educational curator the parts of the museum where they saw opportunities for interactions was eye opening. It’s always one thing to go into a gallery with the perspective of the designer and see where the room for improvement is, but being able to see the spaces of opportunity and need really did help.

Within the Lowe itself I found a space that was moderately engaging at best. The gallery spaces themselves were beautiful and well curated, but I found that the collections that aren’t on display were most interesting.

I think what I found most interesting about visiting the Lowe was trying to find the balance of the classic museum experience with what we are seeing as the emerging technologies of museums. While there are so many things that we can do with technology in museums, who is to say how long that will actually last? Museums as we know them have existed for centuries, and while new technologies can be introduced, the basis of a museum must remain. I found this to be a good experience to have this conversation of what a museum is.

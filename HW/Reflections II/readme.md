# REFLECTION II | ARTECHOUSE

Artechouse has to have been my gallery that we visited during out trips. While it felt small and gimmicky from the perspective of their location. I felt that it was the one gallery where the interactive art worked best, and I think its because the people that were developing the interactives were the artists themselves.

The installations in the gallery felt the most natural of them all, even though they were all digital, but all of them properly thought out and installed in a space to best fit their needs. I for the most part don’t enjoy experiences where you need to use your phone or tablet the entire time to experience it, but I didn’t find myself troubled with the notebook AR in the back gallery at all.

What I do hope is that with the space being permanent now, this space can see much growth and change as new installations come and go. The gallery looks like it will give a great space for digital interactions while still having the traditional feel of a museum or gallery.

# CABINET OF CURIOSITIES

I have many irrational fears, just like anyone. For my cabinet I chose to put my fears on display to the world. But with the added twist that before seeing them they would have to attempt to feel them.

My parts were all 3D printed, and then mounted into this shelf I build in the style of a theater with the red velvet curtains.

# SHAPES OF THE WORLD PROTOTYPE

“The Lowe Art Museum offers its diverse audiences opportunities and resources for engaging with contemporary culture through 5,000 years of human creativity.”

#### SHAPES OF THE WORLD
This project aims to weave threads through the Lowe’s vast collection of 5,000 years of human creativity, and provide museum guests a connection to the past through modern symbols. Using recognizable shapes and symbols like stars, crowns, and plants; which can found in works in every collection in the museum, guests will be able to find not only a personal connection to the artwork, but find connections between the various cultures and centuries.

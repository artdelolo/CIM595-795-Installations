# SHAPES OF THE WORLD PROTOTYPE

The Lowe Art Museum offers its diverse audiences opportunities and resources for engaging with contemporary culture through 5,000 years of human creativity.

#### SHAPES OF THE WORLD
This project aims to weave threads through the Loweâ€™s vast collection of 5,000 years of human creativity, and provide museum guests a connection to the past through modern symbols. Using recognizable shapes and symbols like stars, crowns, and plants; which can found in works in every collection in the museum, guests will be able to find not only a personal connection to the artwork, but find connections between the various cultures and centuries.

###### Version I
* Guests prompted at museum entrance to use cellphones or tablet to use Guide by Cell to collect images of specific shapes in the museum galleries.
* Guests then can go out into the gallery and look for symbols they recognize in all the art in the museum. Take a photo of the symbol and upload it to a database.
(This is a great option for tours as each group can pick a different symbol to look for)
* Back at the museum entrance an interactive display can populate based on the photographs that have been uploaded so how how guests interpreted the prompt and shapes.

###### Version II
* Guests prompted at museum entrance to use cellphones or tablet to use Guide by Cell to explore the shapes around the world.
* Artworks that contain the symbols highlighted will have wall plaque with image and QR code with the shape.
* Code leads to GBC page with information on the meaning of the shape in the collection, will also mention what other collections the shape can be found in.

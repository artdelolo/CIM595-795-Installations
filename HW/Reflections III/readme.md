# REFLECTION III | KISLAK CENTER

The Kislak Center’s “Open New Worlds” exhibit was such a wonderful space to be in. Though a little hidden in plain sight if you will, the possibilities of working on such a specific exhibit with the collection seems so exciting.

I really loved how intimate the space in the gallery felt. All the items in the exhibit felt small, and precious, but the low ceilings and dim light make the gallery feel more comfortable so you could get closer to the artifacts. Being able to experience it with Arthur really gave me a deeper understanding into just what it took to bring so many ideas on exploration together.

Now, while the touch table itself I thought was rather neat. The other two interactives I was less than impressed by. The silent movie for one could have just been playing on a screen on a loop, without making the viewer have to hunch over to watch a 20 minute film. The book on the other hand, I actually really loved, but there was just so much content in it. It could almost have been split into two different ones. I really think there is great opportunity within the space and collection so I’m excited to see what else comes out.
